# Streamlit Cloud defaults to the latest available Python interpreter (e.g., 3.12),
# which can cause compatibility issues with native C-extension packages like opencv-python.
# Explicitly setting pythonVersion to 3.10 ensures ABI compatibility and stable wheel support 
# for OpenCV and other compiled dependencies during deployment.

pythonVersion = "3.10"
